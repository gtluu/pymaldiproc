# pyMALDIproc

pyMALDIproc is a library designed for mass spectrometrists that aggregates methods from different libraries to allow 
users to easily process and work with MALDI-TOF dried droplet data, similar to the [MALDIquant](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MALDIquant/index.html) R package.
