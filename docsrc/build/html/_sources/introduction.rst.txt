About pyMALDIproc
-----------------
pyMALDIproc is an Python library that provides a basic framework for preprocessing MALDI-(q)TOF dried droplet mass
spectrometry datasets. Included are methods for spectrum trimming, intensity transformation, baseline smoothing,
baseline removal, intensity normalization, spectrum binning, peak picking, and deisotoping that have been aggregated
from a variety of different libraries. Feature tables can then be created from datasets and exported to CSV formats for
usage with downstream analysis platforms. pyMALDIproc can be used with open data formats (i.e. mzML and mzXML) and raw
Bruker timsTOF fleX data (TSF/TIMS off datasets).

About pyMALDIviz
----------------
pyMALDIviz is a Dash dashboard created to allow for basic visualization of MALDI-(q)TOF mass spectrometry datasets.
Users can use this visualization tool to evaluate the effects of various preprocessing steps on their data to tune
preprocessing methods/workflows.
